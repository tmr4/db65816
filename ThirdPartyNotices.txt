Forth has a long tradition of being placed in the public domain. Tali Forth
2 for the 65c02 continues this tradition. Where external code was used, it was
also from the public domain, see source code for documentation of individual
routines. 

Tali Forth 2 for the 65c02 is provided on an "as is" basis without any warranty
of any kind, including, without limitation, the implied warranties of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose and their equivalents
under the laws of any jurisdiction. Put briefly, use this at your own risk.
